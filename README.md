# Neuromatch NLP Project
This repository contains my implementation for the NLP project in the Neuromatch summer school 2025. This project aims to examine whether models trained solely on English data can perform zero-shot sentiment analysis in both Romance languages (e.g., Spanish, French, and Italian) and typologically diverse languages (e.g., Chinese), without relying on machine translation.

In this notebook, I conducted and assessed the performance of pre-trained mBERT embeddings combined with logistic regression or an RNN classifier for cross-lingual sentiment classification.
# # xlm-roberta-base.ipynb
In this notebook, I implemented and evaluated the performance of a pre-trained large lanuage model -- xlm-roberta for cross-lingual sentiment classification.
